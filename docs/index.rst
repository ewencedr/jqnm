jqnm's documentation: index
===========================

`jqnm` is a JAX-accelerated Python package for computing Kerr quasinormal
mode frequencies, separation constants, and spherical-spheroidal
mixing coefficients.

This package is a JAX-based rewrite of the `qnm <https://github.com/duetosymmetry/qnm>`_ 
package, providing GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation capabilities.

For a quick start, take a look at the `usage section <README.html#quick-start>`_ of the README.
